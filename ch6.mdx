"You’ve come all this way, so of course that means you're accepting the proposal, right?"

"The marriage arrangement was something forced on me by my father, but if my partner is you, I’d like to ask for your hand myself."

Vee tilted her head slightly, and I decided to just come out and say it. I told her the whole story. But I also made sure to say how I truly felt.

After all, I’ve been working hard for these past nine years— So I could one day stand beside you.

"I'm glad," she said, with a soft smile.

Vee placed a hand lightly on her chest and gave a graceful nod after hearing my reply.

"Then, once again I'm Violet, eldest daughter of the House of Margrave Harvey."

"I’m Theodore, second son of the House of Count Allerton."

I bowed as well, mirroring her. And that’s when it hit me.

Come to think of it, nine years ago she only ever gave me the nickname “Vee.” I knew the Harvey family's heiress was named Violet, but I never connected that name with the girl I knew as Vee. That was careless of me.

"So your name is Violet. That's why you go by Vee."

"Yes. It's a nickname only used among my family, so you're likely the only one outside of them who will call me that. Well though now, I suppose we are family, aren't we?"

"Ah. Yeah, I guess we are."

The way Vee smiled soft and sweet was charming, and quite the contrast to the knight's uniform she was currently wearing. But she wore it well. Extremely well.

I mean, she’s the next head of the Harvey family... and she's going to be my wife? Is this real? I’m not dreaming, right?

"Umm... so then, is it alright if I continue to call you Vee?"

"Of course. As long as you remember that my formal name is Violet, that will be enough, Lord Theodore."

Since I had her permission, I decided I'd keep calling her Vee. Yes, that settles it.

As I was thinking that, Vee gently took my arm. Her slender, yet firm arm looped through mine.

"I’ve arranged a place to stay in Lufen for now. Let’s rest there for the night and head to our territory tomorrow. You’ll need time to prepare, after all."

"Yes, I understand. I would be grateful if I can prepare properly."

Hearing the plan from Vee was reassuring. After all, I was practically thrown out of the house this morning.

Putting aside the preparations, at least I can rest. That's a relief.

Really relieved, but...

…Yeah, I expected a noble to arrange somewhere decent, but this was more than I imagined.

"The entire place is reserved until our departure tomorrow morning. Since we are not yet married, our bedrooms will be separate, so please rest well, Lord Theodore."

"R-right."

Apparently, she had rented out the finest lodging in all of Lufen. It was for the two of us and the entire knight corps accompanying her. I’d heard it’s so fancy it rarely gets used.

And because Vee and I are the two of highest status here, we each got our own private suite. The room we're in now is the sitting room of her suite. Even the "private" rooms come with two chambers naturally.

At the moment, we were drinking tea prepared by a maid who came with her. The warmth of the tea helped me relax.

"Spending money in places like this is part of a noble's duty."

"True. A place of this caliber wouldn’t be used by anyone but nobles or wealthy merchants anyway. And paying what it's worth is only proper."

I could accept that. My parents never spent much on me, but they did invest plenty in my older brother, the heir to the Allerton name or at least, I assume so. Outfits for social events, furnishings for his room, preparations for his wedding...

The point is, we have money. And one of a noble’s responsibilities is to keep the economy moving by spending it. In our family’s case, the source of that money might be a bit questionable, though.

"You haven’t had lunch yet, have you? I’ve had something prepared for us to enjoy together."

"I’d like that very much."

I nodded immediately at her offer. Honestly, I hadn’t eaten much of anything this morning. Plus, sharing lunch means we’ll have time to talk more.

"Even if it was just a verbal promise, how did the Harvey family's heiress manage to bring in the less-visible second son of a count’s house as her husband? I’m very curious about that story."

"My, Lord Theodore."

I wondered for a second if I had phrased that a bit too teasingly.

But Vee only smiled, her eyes narrowing with amusement, and nodded.

"Of course. I’ll tell you everything I know."

No, I seriously want to know. My father, no matter how poorly he treated me, was willing to so easily marry off his second son.

I'm extremely curious about how Vee and the Harvey family managed it.

"However, there are parts I simply don’t know myself. For the full story, please ask my father once we arrive. I can only tell you what I personally know, Lord Theodore."

"Yes... you’re right."

Her words made sense. In any case, once we arrive at the Harvey estate, I’ll be meeting her father—the current head of the family. There are probably things I’ll only be able to learn then.

After all...

“When I grow up, I’ll ask my father— so I can come bring you home, I promise.”

That’s what Vee said to me, nine years ago. For her to make good on that promise, her father would’ve had to get involved.

How exactly did she make that childish vow a reality?

I’m dying to find out.

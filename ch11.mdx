We arrived at the Margrave Harvey’s estate.

The property was quite spacious, with a solidly built two-story mansion, an orchard, and even fields. In comparison, the Allerton estate is also technically two stories, but it feels more modest. There were no fields, just a garden. Well, I suppose these things vary by region, so it doesn't matter.

The carriage I had been riding stopped at the front entrance. When the door opened, what greeted me was Vee’s bright smile.

“Lord Theodore!”

“So we’re here. I’ll be right out.”

“Yes!”

Just as I was about to rise, I noticed Vee reaching her hand toward me. Ah, could it be—

"Please, take my hand. I've always wanted to do this."

“Eh? Ah… sure.”

I knew it. In cities like Lufen and Chaniol, Sir Dante had taken on this role. It’s not common for a woman to help a man down from a carriage, after all.

Still, this was Vee’s family home, and I’d be staying here from now on. We were at the front entrance, so there was nothing inappropriate about it. With that in mind, I took Vee’s hand and stepped down from the carriage. She was in her knight’s uniform, and she had said she wanted to do it.

“Well, I suppose women rarely get the chance to do this.”

“That’s right. And besides, I wouldn’t want to do it for anyone but you, Lord Theodore.”

“I see. In that case, I’ll be the one helping you down from now on.”

“Then I’ll look forward to it.”

Once I was on the ground and had let go of her hand, I offered her my elbow in return. She smoothly linked arms with me. That seemed to be the right move.

As we approached the entrance, we were met by a broad-shouldered older man with silver hair. He was dressed formally, had a scar on his face that gave him a slightly intimidating look, and his back was perfectly straight. He had the air of a retired military man who now managed domestic affairs.

“Welcome home, my lady. And this gentleman?”

“I’m home, Damian. This is Lord Theodore. But you already know that, don’t you?”

“Yes, of course.”

The man, Damian, who seemed to be speaking with Vee, apparently knew who I was. That meant he was probably one of the people who had investigated me and the Allerton family alongside the Margrave. I owe him thanks.

“It is an honor to meet you, Lord Theodore. I serve as the steward of House Harvey. My name is Damian.”

“Pleased to meet you. I’m Theodore Allerton. I’ll be in your care from now on.”

As I bowed in return, he raised his hand to stop me.

“That will do, sir.”

I looked up, surprised, and found Damian observing me with a cold, sharp gaze. He was assessing me.

“I understand things were difficult for you in House Allerton, but here in House Harvey, you are the intended husband of the young lady. In other words, you are the master to me and the rest of the staff. Please do not forget that.”

"...You're right. I'll be mindful of that."

This man, or rather, House Harvey was quite aware of how I’d been treated back home. Even so, he was urging me to carry myself as a proper master now. If I were to stand beside Vee, that was the way it had to be.

I had no home to return to. House Allerton likely no longer even thought of me as a second son married off. More like a piece they sacrificed to forge ties with House Harvey.

But here in House Harvey, I had Vee. She noticed my glance and smiled gently back at me. And there were the people who had acted on her childhood words, the ones who had brought me here.

"I will strive to be someone you can be glad to have served. I wish to learn the customs of this place as well, so please lend me your strength, Damian."

“Of course, Lord Theodore. You can count on me.”

As I expressed my resolve, Damian gave me a deep bow, then looked between the two of us.

“My lady, Lord Theodore. The master and mistress are waiting inside. Please, come in.”

He narrowed his eyes slightly, then turned sharply and began to lead the way. He really did look cool.

Then Vee leaned in close and whispered in my ear.

“Damian is one of my grandfather’s most trusted men. Before retiring, he was my father’s martial instructor.”

“Your grandfather’s… I see. That explains a lot.”

So he had served the previous head of House Harvey — Vee’s grandfather and had also been the current Margrave’s combat teacher.

I might end up training under him too. My body should be in decent shape. I’ll do my best to keep up. Standing beside Vee in her knight’s uniform doesn’t feel bad at all — and if she were in a dress, I’d need to protect her even more.

…Though honestly, even in a dress, I feel like she’d still be just as strong. Must be my imagination.

“Now then. This way, please.”

With a low creak, the heavy doors opened. The hall beyond was an open entrance chamber with high ceilings. A skylight made it surprisingly bright.

“Father, Mother. I’ve returned with Lord Theodore.”

“Oh, our dear Vee. We’ve been waiting. That was faster than I expected!”

“Indeed. I wouldn’t have minded if you took a detour and went on a little date along the way, you know?”

…Um.

Vee was all smiles and seemed in a wonderful mood, which was fine.

But the man with wild red curls, even bigger than Damian and likely the Margrave himself, was positively beaming.

Beside him, a woman with light brown hair who strongly resembled Vee, so probably the Margravine was smiling just as brightly and saying things like that.

How am I supposed to react to this? Someone, please tell me.

And so, early in the morning three days later.

My father, who always keeps up appearances, for my marriage into another house, prepared a reasonably proper carriage and escort. It didn’t bear the crest of the House of Count Allerton, but it was a decently made guest carriage.

As for the soldiers accompanying the carriage were supposedly members of the Royal Capital Guardian Knights under Father’s command.  Is this really okay? We should have our own private soldiers, right?

Well, I wasn’t about to complain. Even if I did, it would just earn me a fist to the face.

 “Be sure not to offend His Excellency the Margrave or his daughter. At the very least, fulfill your role as a stud horse.”

“…Yes.”

With a grin on his face, Father drove the point home with that awful remark. Only he and Barlot came to see me **off**. Mother and Rodrick weren’t present they were probably still asleep, as it was earlier than their usual wake-up time.

Not that I needed to hear it aloud to understand Father’s intentions. By marrying me into the House of Margrave Harvey, he aimed to strengthen our ties with them and use that connection to negotiate better deals on tariffs and tolls with the neighboring country.

"I've put a bolt of silk in with your wedding gifts. Make sure you promote it properly."

“Yes.”

Silk is the specialty product of Allerton County. Since the territory is near the Royal Capital and the quality is decent, even the royal family pays attention to it. That makes it a prized commodity among many noble houses, contributing significantly to our household income.

That said, we’re seriously overcharging. When you account for production costs and labor, we’re selling it for at least double what it’s worth. I’ve seen the paperwork for taxes and such so I know what I’m talking about.

Rodrick surely knows this too, but he says nothing. And even if I pointed it out, neither he nor Father would listen.

Still, Allerton is thriving because of it, so to them, there’s no problem. Selling silk cheaply made by our people for a high price elsewhere is just "good business" in their eyes. …If I recall correctly, Mother’s family included merchants.

Honestly, being tied to a house like this might be worse than going off to become a stud horse for someone else’s family. That’s how I ended up feeling. Damn it, my life is really over.

With that thought, I bowed deeply.

 “Well then, Father, thank you for everything. Please give my regards to Mother and Rodrick.”

 “Very well. From this point on, your home is the House of Margrave Harvey. Work hard and lay your bones there.”

..._Never come back._

He might as well have said it plainly. But I was already thinking the same thing.

Once we left the estate and the town surrounding it, one of the knights escorting us spoke to me through the carriage window.

 “Lord Theodore, We've been told that a unit from the Harvey household will come to meet you at the town of Lufen. We will escort you that far."

“Understood. Thank you.”

At least this man seems decent. …Wait a second.

Lufen is a town at the edge of Allerton County. There’s a Royal Capital Guardian Knights’ outpost there, and both Father and Rodrick are occasionally dispatched to assignments in that area.

Could it be—

 “Excuse me, but are all of you part of a unit being deployed to Lufen?”

 “...Yes. Our unit commander said it was convenient since we’re headed to the same place.”

I knew it. Father didn’t want to spend money using our own private soldiers, so he piggybacked on the knights' deployment to send me along.

That’s also why we’re not using a carriage with the Allerton crest. If it had the family insignia, we’d have to bring it back from Lufen.

Isn’t that an inappropriate use of the Knight Order? If I report this to the commander, Father might face serious consequences.

 “...Shouldn’t the commander of the Knight Order be informed about this?”

 “All reports are first reviewed by our unit commander.”

The knight replied, clearly apologetic. Right, Father would check the paperwork first, making it impossible to report him.

"...I see. I apologize for my father's foolishness."

 “Not at all.”

With that, the conversation ended for now. I couldn’t know where Father’s eyes and ears might be. The coachman, even the knight himself, could be one of his loyal subordinates.

Father can be strangely sharp at times. Rodrick didn’t seem to inherit that, which makes me worry for the future of the Allerton household.

Though I’ve been cast out, if something goes wrong, there’s a good chance they’ll shamelessly demand my help or rather, dump their problems on me. That’s likely part of the reason behind sending me into the Harvey household.

I looked out the window.

We’d already left the town behind. Around us stretched grasslands and forests, with fields and ranches scattered here and there. There shouldn’t be many monsters in this area, but from time to time, private troops or Rodrick’s unit patrol the region.

I wasn’t let out of the house much, mostly kept busy drafting documents for Rodrick. I made sure to finish everything I was assigned before leaving but I wonder what they’ll do next. Will they hire a new aide? Or use someone from the Knight Order?

 “...Not my problem anymore, is it?”

The words slipped out of my mouth.

I’ve been sent away from the House of Count Allerton to marry into the House of Margrave Harvey. Father told me to lay my bones there in other words, don’t come back.

Then surely, anything that happens within the House of Allerton from now on has nothing to do with me. I’m no longer one of them.

From this point on, the House of Margrave Harvey is my home. I’ll serve them instead. What that will mean, I don’t yet know.

Vee… maybe I was only able to leave that house because I gave it my all. It’s thanks to your words

***Thank you.***

As those thoughts filled my mind, I began to doze off.

Lufen is only half a day’s journey away.

A count’s household that won’t even cover the full cost of sending off their son to marry… I wonder what the House of Allerton looks like from the outside.

I suppose I’ll come to learn soon enough.

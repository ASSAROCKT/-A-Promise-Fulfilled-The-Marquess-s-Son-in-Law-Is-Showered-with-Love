We arrived in the town of Lufen a little after midday. Since we’d left the house early in the morning, it was a reasonable arrival time.

Strictly speaking, though, the carriage veered off the main road shortly before reaching the town. There was a sudden jolt, and I tilted my head in confusion.

"Did we leave the road?"

 “Yes. We’re scheduled to meet the Harvey family’s unit at this location.”

"Ah, so that's what this is about."

That was the knight’s response when I asked. In other words, if they brought me directly into town, the Royal Capital Guardian Knights might be accused of being used for personal matters so they’re handing me over before reaching the town. Just how stingy can Father be?

Before long, the carriage came to a stop. I looked out the window and saw that we’d arrived in what appeared to be a clearing. I wasn’t sure why a place like this existed, but apparently, it did.

 “Theodore, second son of the House of Count Allerton, has arrived!”

The knight accompanying me raised his voice. Ahead of our group, another carriage unit was already waiting.

The carriages were sturdy and practical built for durability rather than show. The knights leading them were similarly equipped, dressed not for ceremony but for actual combat. …The one in front was slightly smaller than the knight traveling with us.

The crest displayed on the carriages and armor was unmistakably that of the House of Margrave Harvey— the house I was marrying into.

 “We’ve been expecting you. I am Dante Statt, commander of the Harvey family’s direct knight corps. I have come to escort Lord Theodore.”

The one who called out with a firm and commanding voice wasn’t the smaller knight at the front, but rather a sturdier man standing beside them—apparently this was Dante. That kind of voice certainly carried more authority.

Even though this marriage was arranged by mutual agreement, they still went to the trouble of sending someone all the way into Allerton territory to greet me. personally, no less, and not just anyone, but the commander of their direct knight corps. I bowed my head in the carriage and silently thought: I’m sorry it’s me.

 “Sir Statt, I appreciate the trouble. I entrust Lord Theodore to your care from here.”

 “Of course. Maximil, see to the transfer of the cargo.”

 “Yes, sir.”

At the command from our knight, Dante turned and gave orders to one of his subordinates. The "cargo" likely referred to the little luggage I had and more importantly, the bolts of silk Father had foisted upon me.

Despite acting on orders from his superior, our knight had done his job properly. I really did want to find a way to report all of this to the Knight Commander… but, hmm.

While I was pondering that, the carriage door opened. The knight who had been speaking with me offered his hand.

"If you please, Lord Theodore."

 “Thank you.”

From here on, I would travel to the Harvey domain with their knights. This was goodbye to the knight who had accompanied me thus far.

I stepped down onto the ground and stretched lightly. Sitting for so long had made my body stiff.

When I turned to face them, Dante was already looking at me. Right, I needed to introduce myself first.

 “I am Theodore Allerton. Thank you for coming all this way on such short notice.”

 “Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Dante Statt, commander of the Harvey family’s direct knight corps. I have come to escort you, Lord Theodore.”

When I instinctively bowed my head, Dante knelt before me. I almost panicked, but since this was proper etiquette, there was no point in me getting flustered.

After all, I am the second son of a Count’s house, and he serves the Margrave into whose family I am marrying.

 “Please do not worry about the circumstances of this arrangement. We are knights sworn to the House of Harvey. It is only natural that we come to welcome one who will join our lord’s family.”

 “That’s very reassuring to hear. Please, you may rise.”

 “As you wish.”

I said something to allow Dante to stand. People like him especially the very proper sort would remain kneeling indefinitely if you didn’t tell them otherwise… Father and Rodrick used to instruct me to do the same.

I’m probably not very accustomed to living as a noble. I just hope I won’t be a burden to the Harvey family.

 “Sir Statt, please take good care of Lord Theodore.”

 “I will. You needn’t worry.”

As the knight who had accompanied me and Dante exchanged words, Dante stepped slightly aside and the smaller figure who had been leading the Harvey group stepped forward.

Even without guessing, I could tell this person was a woman. Not just from her size, but her build as well. Her horse had been led away by the other knights, and it followed them calmly. Well-trained—good to see.

 “It’s been a long time, Lord Theodore.”

 “Eh?”

When she called my name, it took me a moment to realize it was me she was addressing.

She removed her helmet, and long, pale red hair spilled out, swaying gently as she smiled. Her lightly tanned skin and clear golden-brown eyes were strikingly lovely.

 “I’ve come to fulfill the promise we made nine years ago, Lord Theodore.”

 “Nine years…”

Of course I hadn’t forgotten the words she spoke as she extended her hand.

Nine years ago.

Rodrick’s tenth birthday.

The girl with the pale red hair from back then.

 “...Vee.”

 “Yes! I’m so glad you remembered!”

As I took her hand instinctively, her face lit up with joy. She wrapped her hands around mine, both above and below.

There was no mistaking it. Vee, the one who spoke to me all those years ago, who told me to wait because she would come for me.

So she was the daughter of the Margrave. We're the same age, so she’s one year younger than Rodrick. That’s about right for a potential fiancée of his, I guess. Though she didn’t make the cut for Rodrick… but, well, that’s fine.

 “Sorry it took so long. But just as I promised back then I’ve come to take you with me.”

 “You came in person?”

 “Of course. You’re to be my husband, after all.”

**Smiling from ear to ear.**

That smile told me everything I needed to know my efforts hadn’t been in vain.

…Nine years. It had all been worth it. Because I believed in the words she said—

**_wait for me_.**

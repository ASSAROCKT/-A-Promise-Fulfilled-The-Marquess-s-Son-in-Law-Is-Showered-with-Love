With her light red hair fluttering in the breeze, the girl extended her hand to me.

"I have come to fulfill the promise from nine years ago, Lord Theodore."

The promise from nine years ago.

Having lived my life holding those words in my heart, I took her hand without any hesitation.

That was at the birthday party celebrating my elder brother, Rodrick, turning ten. Since he turns nineteen this year, that makes it exactly nine years ago.

“Hey, you— go stand over there. I’m the main attraction today, so don’t try to steal the spotlight.”

“Y-yes. Understood.”

I was just one year younger than him. After greeting the guests alongside my family, I was promptly shoved off to the corner of the hall by my brother.

As the eldest son of the Allerton family. a noble house known for producing military officers. Rodrick was already acting the part of the next Count. He mingled with the noble guests, engaged in polite conversation, and was introduced to the many young ladies brought by their parents. In short, it was a matchmaking event.

“With Rodrick, House Allerton is in good hands.”

“Indeed. He’s a fine heir—I couldn’t be more pleased. Assuming he continues to mature properly, of course.”

“Quite right. So, what do you think of my daughter?”

“Now, now, don’t get ahead of yourself. I was just about to ask what you thought of _my_ daughter.”

My father, the current head of the house, also holds the positions of Vice-Commander of the Royal Capital Guardian Knights and Commander of the First Division. In other words, he's a high-ranking military official, so a great number of nobles who wished to marry their daughters to his eldest son were in attendance. It seems my father sent out the invitations with that very intention.

In contrast, I, the second son, was merely someone who was no match for my brother, only a year my senior, when it came to brute strength. As for intellect... I don't know. We never once studied together. I did have a private tutor, and I liked to read books, though.

My father once told me to "try and have a match," and we fought with wooden swords, but I was utterly beaten to a pulp. It was supposed to be a sword match, but in the end, I was punched and kicked.

_“Theodore. With skills like that, you’ll never find a place in the Knights. Fortunately, you have a fine older brother in Rodrick. Your role is to support him.”_

That was my father’s decree. According to him—and his father before him—all the Allerton heirs began showing their physical prowess around the age of ten. Since I hadn’t, I was just a weak, useless disappointment.

To Father, the only son worth loving was the one with muscle and a sword in hand. If I’d been born a girl, I imagine I’d have been raised with the goal of marrying into a respectable family.

"What's wrong?"

Anyway.

Since the food being served was good, I had taken some on my plate and was eating silently, as if hiding behind a curtain.

When someone suddenly spoke to me, I jumped with a start, but I somehow managed not to drop the roast beef in my mouth. I chewed it up, swallowed, and then turned around.

"W-what is it?"

“I was just wondering why you were sitting in a corner all by yourself.”

The voice belonged to a girl with light red, slightly wavy hair and sun-kissed skin. Her dress was finely made. Clearly, she was a nobleman's daughter. In other words, another one of my brother’s potential fiancées.

My brother was... ah, it seems he's now talking with Father and Mother to another family. Then, it should be okay.

"I was told not to stand out. Because unlike my brother, I'm no good."

"Is that so? But my father tells me it's fine to just do my best at what I'm good at."

"My father wants a child who’s strong in battle. But I’d rather read books than fight"

"Huh? Isn't that amazing?"

Hearing that from the girl, my eyes went wide.

For me, a member of the House of Allerton—a house it would be no exaggeration to say is built on the martial arts—to like reading books.

It was the first time in my life anyone had ever called that "amazing." Even my mother, who married into the family from another house, was of the opinion that it was only natural for an Allerton man to fight and win.

However, the reason this girl said it was amazing was a little different.

"Because I'm not good at reading books. When there are a lot of words, I get sleepy."

"But you have to study properly. When you grow up and have to do your family's work, you'll need to be able to read a lot of words."

"...I suppose that's true. My father sometimes lets his work pile up and gets scolded by my mother."

_No, wait a minute,_ I thought at the time, but I couldn't bring myself to comment on that.

The "father" she was talking about must surely be the head of some house. The idea of him letting his work pile up and being scolded by his wife was a scene I could hardly imagine.

From then, I talked with her for a while. During that time, I think I asked her name.

"I'm Theodore."

"That's a lovely name. As for me... yes, call me Vee."

"Okay, I understand. Vee, right?"

Was her real name long, or did she just like being called Vee? In any case, that's all she told me, so in the end, I never learned her real name.

But well, perhaps because I thought we would probably never meet again... I feel like I told Vee all sorts of things I could never say to my family. Like how Father and Mother only doted on my brother, or how my brother might see me as nothing more than a henchman or something.

"I see. Yes, I understand."

Vee listened to my whole story and then gave a big nod.

"Theodore. When we get older, I'll ask my father and I'll definitely, absolutely come for you. So until then, do your best. We're the same age, so let's both do our best together."

"...Y-yeah."

Just as she said that, the surroundings became a little noisy, and with that as our cue, Vee and I parted ways. I watched her light red hair for a long time as she waved and walked away.

That night, I was thoroughly scolded by my father. He said that since I was the incompetent younger brother, I should have been talking in a way that praised my older brother.

Even now, I think that was just unreasonable. Besides, they managed to find a fiancée for my brother just fine, didn't they?

The one who became engaged to my brother was the young lady of a Marquis house, a relative of my mother's. After this, my father expanded his influence within the Royal Capital Guardian Knights, and my brother would eventually join their ranks as well.

And so, I was essentially confined to the house, purely as my brother's aide. He even got a birthday party thrown for him, but there was nothing for me.

And yet, the reason I was able to endure for the nine years since then was because of Vee's words.

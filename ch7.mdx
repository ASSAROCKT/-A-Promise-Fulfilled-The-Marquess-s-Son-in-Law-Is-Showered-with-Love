"Yes, I suppose I should start from the beginning.

It was nine years ago, on the night after Lord Rodrick's birthday party had ended."

"Father."

I brought the matter up with my father at the inn we had taken near the Allerton estate. The meeting with Lord Rodrick had been, in effect, a formal matchmaking attempt, so when I broached the topic, my father’s expression briefly stiffened.

"I spoke with Lord Theodore."

"Theodore...? Ah, the second son of the Allerton family."

It seems my father was quite puzzled when I mentioned Lord Theodore’s name instead of Lord Rodrick’s. Though, I believe he had seen us talking during the party.

"For you to bring him up, it seems he was easier to talk to than Lord Rodrick."

"Yes! He said he preferred reading books over going to war!"

"Ugh."

Hee hee.

Even now, my father is not fond of administrative work. Of course, he properly reads through important documents and communicates well with the civil officials, so there shouldn't be a problem. Besides, Mother keeps a close eye on him.

But, well, that aside...

"Hmm. I see."



I told my father everything Lord Theodore had shared with me. Every detail. As expected, even his brow furrowed slightly. After all, even if it was Lord Rodrick’s birthday party, telling Lord Theodore just a year younger to stay quietly in a corner of the room so as not to draw attention... what kind of parents give such an order?

If he were normally unruly, it might be understandable but this is Lord Theodore we’re talking about.

Granted, at least they didn’t order him to leave entirely. Still, Father speculated that it was likely easier to monitor him if he stayed within sight.

On top of that, both parents clearly favored Lord Rodrick, and the boy himself seemed to view his younger brother merely as a piece on the board to be moved. At just ten years old, Lord Rodrick already had that attitude. Even I, as a child, could tell Lord Theodore’s future didn’t look bright.

"That said, we are not relatives of the Allerton family. If we were, for instance, from the lady of the house's family, we might be permitted to intervene."

But as my father rightly pointed out, at that time, we had no standing to interfere in the inner workings of House Allerton. So he decided to start by gathering information.

"Let’s keep an eye on the Allerton household for now. Can you wait one year, my dear Vee?"

"A year?"

"Theodore is the same age as you, isn’t he? That means next year he’ll turn ten."

Now I understand what my father meant, but back then, I needed him to explain it more clearly. I still had a lot to learn at the time.

"I want to see if they’ll hold a birthday party for him like they did for Rodrick. For a second son of a count, it wouldn’t be unusual to have a face shown publicly if they intend to arrange a political marriage. So a party would make sense."

That’s what it came down to. I remember nodding and asking him:

"If they do hold one, I want to attend again."

"Yes. If that happens, I’ll make sure an invitation reaches us. If not, I’ll consider other options."

"I understand. If you say so, Father."

…If a birthday party for Lord Theodore had actually been held the following year, I would have attended with great joy.

But, that didn’t happen.

"So that confirms it. The Allerton household clearly treats Theodore differently from Rodrick. Any future engagement will likely be arranged solely for the sake of political convenience."

By the time of Lord Theodore’s birthday which was easy enough to find out my father had already drawn that conclusion.

"Of course, it’s not uncommon for the heir and the second son to be treated differently. But even so, at a party full of guests like ourselves, they made almost no effort to introduce the second son, who is only a year younger."

"Yes. Apparently, Lord Theodore was told to stay out of his brother’s way and remain quietly off to the side."

"Mm. Marge discreetly looked into it for us. It seems Theodore was being groomed to support Rodrick. That’s fairly standard for a second son, but he’s not even of age to take on duties yet."

From what I’ve heard, Lord Theodore was still assisting Lord Rodrick with clerical work and paperwork until just recently. So, that would be… eight years ago now. Even then, it seems their parents already had that future mapped out for him.

I know it may sound harsh, but I believe they intended to keep him quietly tucked away within the Allerton household.

And, well, Lord Theodore seems to think so too. That all but confirms it.

"Rodrick now has a fiancée, and it’s clear he will inherit House Allerton. Now then, Vee— what about you?"

Putting that aside, my father suddenly turned the question to me. I lifted my chin and answered proudly.

"I am the eldest daughter of House Harvey. If nothing goes wrong, I will succeed the house."

"True. But it’s not guaranteed yet, is it?"

"No. I must prove myself and secure my position as heir with my own merit… isn’t that right, Father?"

The House of Margrave Harvey earned its title through military strength. The head of the family is expected to be capable on the battlefield. Without that, even as the firstborn, I could be passed over.

But my father told me:

"Exactly. You must seize the position of my successor— future head of House Harvey. Do that, and I will bring in the husband of your choosing."

Yes.

I worked hard so I could welcome Lord Theodore into my life. I trained my body, studied the martial arts, and honed my swordsmanship.

And as a result, I— Violet Harvey— secured my position as heir on my sixteenth birthday, two years ago. I did so through strength.

What do I mean by “through strength”?

There were members of our cadet branches who had also reached a suitable age. They came to the main house and challenged me to duels. It was decreed that whoever stood victorious would be named the next head of House Harvey.

Had I lost, the winner would have become the heir— either as my husband or as my adoptive sibling. But I won.

After all, I was already the vice-captain of the Harvey family’s Guardian Knight Corps at the time. The uniform I wore when I reunited with Lord Theodore was part of my formal duties. The horse I rode is the same one I ride regularly— my personal steed.

I believe… that’s as much of the story as I can tell you, Lord Theodore.

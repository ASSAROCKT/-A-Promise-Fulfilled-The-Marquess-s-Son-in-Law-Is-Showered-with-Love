We left Lufen the next day and crossed out of Allerton territory. After spending two more nights in another post town, we finally entered Harvey territory on the evening of the third day.

Allerton and Harvey territory aren’t particularly far apart. Allerton lies about a day’s carriage ride from the royal capital, and heading from there toward the border, you pass into Harvey’s domain. All in all, the journey took about five days. The Kingdom of Komulas isn’t especially large to begin with.

We spent one more night in the first town after entering Harvey land, and the next day, around noon, we arrived in a lively city. If I recall correctly, this was the commercial city of Chaniol—one of Father’s trading partners for silk. I’d seen the name in the ledgers.

 “We’ll be staying here for today.”

We rolled into one of the city’s finest mansions— easily among the top two. Vee led on horseback, while I followed in the carriage. She’s a knight, and that’s her personal horse, so of course she’d ride but still.

She reached out her hand to help me down from the carriage.

Normally, it should be the other way around… Yeah. I need to step up. Make sure I can play my part properly. With that in mind, I turned to look at the mansion.

“Does someone you know live here, Vee?”

“Yes, it’s my personal designer.”

 “…What?”

A personal… designer?

Well, I suppose nobles do have people like that. Technically, Allerton has one too. I never interacted with him myself, but my brother had his birthday attire custom-made nine years ago.

Me? I wore Rodrick’s hand-me-downs. Tailored just enough not to look like they were.

 “He handles all our household’s clothing. My parents instructed me to have new garments tailored for you as well, Lord Theodore.”

 “That’s… very kind. I, uh, rarely attend formal events, so I don’t have much in the way of dress clothes.”

 “Of course. Now then, shall we?”

 “Ah yes.”

Vee led the way with confidence. I’m not sure if “cool” is the right word for a woman, but she certainly looked admirable. Still, offering one’s arm and escorting her inside—that’s supposed to be _my_ role. One I won’t yield to anyone.

Beyond the doors was a spacious entrance hall or rather, a grand showroom, lined with elegant dresses and formalwear, likely sample pieces.

At the center stood a tall, middle-aged man. Several others—seamstresses, most likely—stood behind him, dressed in work attire.

 “Welcome, my lady. We’ve been expecting you. And welcome to you as well, my lord.”

 “Randall. I see you're as well as ever.”

His slicked-back black hair framed a composed face. So his name was Randall. Wait, I've heard that name before. Just as I was trying to place it, he offered a courteous nod.

 “I am Randall Shanan, head of the Harvey branch of Shanan Factory. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

 “Wait— _Shanan Factory_?”

His voice was gentle, his tone refined. He gave off the impression of a kind, capable man. But Shanan Factory was one of the silk buyers from Allerton territory. I’m pretty sure he’s even visited our estate before.

Well. This could get awkward.

 “I’m Theodore, second son of House Allerton. I imagine my father drives a hard bargain… I apologize for that.”

I realized only after speaking that I probably shouldn’t have said it—but Randall just offered a faint smile and a shake of the head.

 “We’ve long been grateful for Allerton’s silk. It is, admittedly, a bit costly, but the quality is superb. Please don’t worry.”

 “I… appreciate that.”

Not that anything I say will make Father or Rodrick lower their prices. If anything, they’re probably scheming ways to hike them further across the border.

As my thoughts started to spiral, I felt a gentle tug at my arm. Vee was looking up at me with a soft smile.

Right. I have Vee.

 “Lord Theodore. Let’s leave matters of trade for when we’re back at the estate. For now, it’s time for your measurements.”

 “Ah— yes. Sorry. I’ll be in your care.”

 “Please leave it to me. Everyone— let’s get to work!”

 “Yes, sir!”

At his spirited command, Vee released my arm. A moment later, the workers sprang into action, surrounding me with measuring tapes, rulers, and various tools.

Well… go ahead. Within reason, at least.

 “There we are. Thank you for your patience.”

By the time they’d finished, the sun was beginning to set. They’d even taken molds of my feet—so I’m getting new shoes too, it seems.

I appreciated it. I also felt completely drained.

“Raise your arm,” “straighten your back,” “hold still,” “don’t breathe”—so many instructions, one after another. They asked about my color preferences, checked my hair and eye color, and seemed delighted to compare swatches and options. With my dark blond hair and bright blue eyes, I guess I was easy enough to match.

Randall and I chatted while reviewing swatches. We both had information the other wanted, after all.

 “While House Allerton is one of our partners, we’d heard little about the second son. I’d been curious what kind of man you were.”

 “What kind of impression did I leave? Be honest.”

 “I’d say the young lady has chosen a fine husband. At the very least, you don’t seem like the sort to cause the headaches your elder brother did.”

 “…So my brother _did_ do something, then.”

 “I’ll let your imagination fill in the details.”

Oh, Rodrick. You really did cause trouble, huh? If I didn’t see it in the paperwork, it must’ve been off the record.

Well, that’s no longer my concern. That’s Father’s, Mother’s, and Rodrick’s world now.

As for me—

 “Next time, I won’t hesitate to strike back. Silk is now being produced in other regions, and their quality’s improving fast.”

 “Please do. The profits from Allerton’s silk return far too little to the people who actually live there.”

"Oh my. If that's the case, then there's no need to hold back, jokes aside."

Somehow, Randall and I both laughed at the same moment. It was an oddly pleasant feeling.

I might bring this up with the Margrave’s household too.

It’s not much— but maybe it’s a start. A small step toward repaying the gift of Vee finding me.

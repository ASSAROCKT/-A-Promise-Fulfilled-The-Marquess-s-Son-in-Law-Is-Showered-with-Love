Our carriage journey was nearing its end. Beyond the window, I could see tall stone walls beginning to appear in the landscape.

This was Harve, the central city of the Margraviate of Harvey, the seat of the domain. I’d heard about it before, but seeing it in person it gave a strong impression of being well-fortified.

 “So that’s the city of Harve.”

 “Yes.”

From horseback beside the carriage, Vee gave a small nod. Apparently, the city was named after the Harvey family itself. Vee had made a wry face about it earlier, saying, _“Our ancestors weren’t exactly creative with names.”_ I actually think it’s a good name, though.

 “Our family has always had a fondness for battle, so the place inevitably ended up looking like a fortress.”

The walls drew closer and closer, and they were seriously tall. Just eyeballing it, I’d say they were as high as a three-story building. Well, considering this is the city closest to the center of the domain and the seat of the lord, it makes sense that it would be so heavily fortified. Fortifying an entire city is probably unique to border regions like this.

 “There are natural disasters and monster attacks to worry about too. In those situations, this place serves as a shelter, doesn’t it? I think it’s a smart approach.”

 “Yes. Being near the border, large monsters do appear from time to time… and then there are incidents staged to look like bandit attacks really just provocations from neighboring countries.”

 “Things like that happen?”

 “They’re handled quietly, so the public never hears about them.”

 “Huh…”

As of now, Comras’s relations with its neighboring countries are relatively stable. There haven’t been any major wars since I was born, and even the minor skirmishes that do occur seem to be mostly accidental.

Still, that peace exists thanks to the constant vigilance of people like those here in Harvey, who guard the border. Soon, Vee will be joining their ranks as the Margrave’s heir.

Yeah, I’ve got to pull my weight too. I’m not great at political games, but I guess I’ll need to train… Maybe the Margrave's wife is skilled at that sort of thing. As the head’s spouse, she’d be in a similar position to me.

While we talked, the stone wall loomed right before us. We passed through a massive wooden gate and entered the city.

Inside, it looked like a typical town. The roads were well-maintained. Since we were riding down what must’ve been the main street, the buildings lined up along it were mostly shops and administrative offices. Residential areas seemed to be set farther back.

Given this was the domain’s capital, the streets were fairly crowded. Still, people moved aside to make way for the carriage convoy. It was a bit embarrassing, honestly—I leaned back so my face wouldn’t be visible.

 “Oh! It’s the young lady!”

 “Welcome back!”

 “Hime-sama!”

People were calling out to Vee. I suppose “hime-sama”—lady or princess makes sense for a noble’s daughter. Randale also called her that.

Peeking discreetly out the window, I saw her riding calmly, waving to the townspeople as they called her name. Her horse stayed steady—no signs of danger.

 “She’s amazing…”

Just that simple act showed the results of her hard work nine years’ worth, maybe more. She had earned the trust and support of the people by striving to become a good lord, a worthy successor.

And if everything she said is to be believed… she did all of that so she could bring _me_ here. Me, a second son from a count’s family, called useless, whom she met just once, nine years ago.

 “…”

My face suddenly flushed with heat. I pressed a hand to my cheek—it really was warm.

Am I really someone worth loving that much? I mean, sure, I’ve been holding on to her words all this time too, trying to live up to them.

Even if, outwardly, this is all supposed to be a political marriage… if it hadn’t been Vee, I wouldn’t be here now.

 “Hime-sama! Is the person in that carriage your fiancé?”

 “Indeed he is! He’ll be meeting Father first, but I’ll introduce him to everyone afterward!”

 “Yay!”

 “Pfft—”

I burst out laughing at the exchange I overheard between Vee and the townspeople. Oh right, I’m about to have an audience with the Margrave of Harvey her father. We’ll talk about how I’m the boy she spoke to nine years ago and probably a bunch of other things.

…And after that, I’ll be shown around the town? I mean, if I’m going to be living here, I should probably get to know the place.

But somehow, I’m starting to feel like the townspeople might be tougher to win over than the Margrave himself. Still, if I can earn their approval, I’ll be able to stand proudly at Vee’s side.

 “...Yeah. That’s exactly why I came here, isn’t it?”

I smacked my cheeks lightly with both hands to refocus myself.

Even if my father pushed me into this for the sake of his own interests… even if Vee brought me here because _she_ wanted to… I chose to accept that and board this carriage.

Because I want to be with Vee.

 “Lord Theodore. We’ll be arriving at the Margrave’s estate shortly.”

 “Ah— right.”

Dante’s voice came from outside, and I sat up properly in my seat.

The Margrave’s estate— the residence of Lord Harvey, Vee’s home, and now mine as well.

For Vee, who convinced her father to take me in, I need to do my part.

I’ll build relationships with her family, the staff, and the knights under Dante’s command.

I don't think I'll be treated the way I was back home, but... w-will I be okay?

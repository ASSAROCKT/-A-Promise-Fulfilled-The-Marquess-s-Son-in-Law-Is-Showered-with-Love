  "description": "\"When I grow up, I'll ask my father and promise to come for you. So please, hold on until then.\"\n\nThese words from Vee, a girl he met as a child, became the boy's emotional support, even if it was just a verbal promise.\n\nTheodore, the second son of the House of Count Allerton, is forced to handle all the paperwork that his older brother, Rodrick, should be doing. Unable to match his brother, a member of the Royal Capital's Knightly Order, in skill, Theodore quietly performs these tasks. However, their parents are oblivious to this reality, believing that the younger brother is merely assisting the heir of the family.\n\nAn offer of marriage into the family of the Marquess Harvey suddenly comes to Theodore. His father, wanting to establish a connection with the marquess's family, which is favored by the royal family, quickly decides to push Theodore into it. When Theodore arrives at the marquess's home, the one waiting for him is the very same girl from all those years ago.",

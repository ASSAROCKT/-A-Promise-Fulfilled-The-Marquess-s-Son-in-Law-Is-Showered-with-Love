After receiving what was, from her perspective, probably a broad summary, all I could do was stare at her in disbelief.

We were in a private room in the inn’s dining area just me, Vee, and her maid. Apparently, this maid had been attending to Vee for many years and already knew most of what Vee had just told me.

The meal was being served in stages by the inn’s staff, and the maid assisted in plating everything. Lunch was… absolutely delicious.

“Oh my, is something the matter, Lord Theodore?”

“…No, it’s nothing.”

Right. Now wasn’t the time to just sit and enjoy my food. I swallowed the bite of sautéed fish in my mouth and turned to face Vee.

"It just occurred to me that you've worked so much harder than I have, Vee."

I said honestly what I felt after hearing her story. I’ve mostly done document work. I’ve had a little combat training, sure, but nothing compared to Vee. The Allerton family, like House Harvey, also earned its title through military achievement— but still.

“That’s not true at all. I, um… I take after Father, and I’m not very good with paperwork…”

"Oh dear."

When I looked at her in response, Vee’s face had turned bright red. Likely from embarrassment—she was covering her cheeks with both hands and looking down slightly.

She really is adorable. And at the same time, I realized something—there _is_ something I can do for her. That alone made me feel a little relieved.

“O-of course, I _do_ read all important documents, and I get help from my subordinates to write everything properly!”

“I know. It’s not exactly a comparison I like to make, but my brother is also a knight and the heir to our house, so I have a general understanding of how demanding the job can be.”

“Th-thank you…”

Reading documents, writing necessary reports— that’s all just part of the job. Not everyone fulfills that duty, I know that from experience. But Vee does. That’s why I can genuinely feel at ease.

The only example I’ve had of a “heir candidate serving as a knight” is my brother, and that’s… irritating. Still, being forced to support him gave me firsthand experience with just how much work it really is. Though I’m sure serving the royal family and leading your own house’s knights are entirely different roles.

“Then, if that’s the case… I can support you in your work, Vee. If it’s paperwork, leave it to me.”

I declared what I _could_ do for her. Immediately, Vee’s face lit up—still flushed red, but beaming now.

“P-please do. I’ll continue doing my best as well!”

“Of course. Let’s work hard together.”

“Yes!”

Across the table, I extended my hand and Vee clasped it in both of hers. Slim but strong hands, with the calluses to show the effort behind them.

Proof that she’s been working hard all these years, ever since that day.

“...Haaah.”

I flopped down onto the bed in the room I’d been assigned. I was told I could rest until evening, so I decided to take them up on that offer. We’d be leaving this city for the Harvey territory tomorrow. Resting now was probably the smart move.

This was the inn’s highest-class room, and as expected, the furnishings were better than my own bedroom. Though I still think the linens at the Allerton estate were higher quality.

“…I’m going to be Vee’s husband.”

I set aside all thoughts about Allerton for now.

It’s only been… what, a few hours since I learned that the girl who made that promise to me nine years ago— Vee is actually Violet Harvey, my fiancée? Maybe not even that long. I learned the truth, entered the city, had lunch, and now here I am.

“Just knowing how to process paperwork isn’t going to cut it, is it.”

I murmured to myself without really thinking.

Both House Harvey and House Allerton are noble families that earned their titles through military valor. Whatever politics may be at play behind the scenes, from the outside, this marriage will look like a union between two military houses. It wouldn’t be strange for the world to expect me to live up to that.

“Lord Margrave himself might be expecting that much.”

Margrave Cland Harvey— Vee’s father, the current head of the house, and the one who made this engagement happen.

If I let him down, I’d never be able to face Vee. She fulfilled that childhood promise. I owe it to her.

I, Theodore Allerton, as Vee’s fiancé, have to do my best. I have to make everyone think Vee made the right choice by picking me.

“…And if Father or Brother complain about it… what then?”

My thoughts began to wander somewhere I didn’t mean to go, and I turned my head to the side.

Those two— if I do reasonably well, I’m sure they’ll still find something to criticize. For some reason, the current narrative in House Allerton is that all its achievements belong to Father and Brother, and that I’m useless.

“…Would it be alright to consult Lord Margrave about it?”

Brother aside, if Father starts making trouble, I doubt Vee would be able to resolve it easily. No—physically, she might be able to—but that would only make things worse.

“Well, considering trade tariffs and everything else, I doubt he’d do anything reckless…”

Our family has an interest in silk exports, and we benefit from favorable terms. It’d be foolish to risk that over some petty squabble. Even Father wouldn’t be that stupid. Brother… I’m not sure about.

“If I get an audience with Lord Margrave, I’ll start by expressing my gratitude— then have a proper discussion.”

At the very least, I need to make sure he understands that House Allerton is… a difficult family to deal with.

And if that leads to this engagement being called off— then I guess I’ll have to accept that.

But still.

I want to stay by Vee’s side.

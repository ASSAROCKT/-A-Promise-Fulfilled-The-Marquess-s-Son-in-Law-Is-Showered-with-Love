**Knock, knock, knock.**

“Excuse me, Lord Theodore.”

“Barlot. What is it?”

The one who entered after knocking and opening the door himself was Barlot. The butler of this house, and in other words, my father’s right-hand man.

His perfectly slicked-back white hair and sturdy build are remnants of his past as the master who taught my father how to fight. Of course, he is still strong now. I was flicked away with a single finger. My brother was properly trained by him, which is one of the reasons I can never beat him.

“The Master has summoned you. I’ve been instructed to escort you to his room immediately.”

"Eh? Ah, yes."

When Barlot said that, I couldn’t help but widen my eyes in surprise. Father was summoning me? He was even _home_?

...Still, I doubt it's for anything good. Ever since my brother drilled my position into me, being called somewhere by Barlot or the other servants usually meant mock battles with the newcomers or being used as a test subject for new magic techniques.

Apparently, Allerton men are unusually sturdy, so I’ve become a convenient opponent for training matches.

“I understand. Please lead the way.”

“Very well. This way, sir.”

As I agreed, Barlot briskly exited the room. I hurried after him.

We arrived at Father’s office. A simply designed room, used only by the head of House Allerton.

“Master, I have brought Lord Theodore.”

“Enter.”

“Excuse me, Father.”

Even Barlot, who has served this house since Grandfather’s time, cannot enter without Father’s permission. The only others who come in are my brother, a few of Father’s subordinates, and the cleaning maids.

As for me this was probably the second or third time I’d ever been in here.

Then, Father immediately dropped the reason for summoning me, with a surprisingly cheerful look on his face.

“There’s good news for the House of Allerton. The House of Margrave Harvey has requested to take our son-in-law.”

The House of Margrave Harvey.

One of the families guarding the borders of the Komulas Kingdom, said to be favored by the royal family. Thanks to their watchful eye on neighboring countries, this kingdom has remained peaceful without major wars.

Ah, if I remember right, their heir is their eldest daughter, Lady Violet... Wait. _Their son-in-law_—does that mean...?

“Forming ties with a house trusted by the royal family will elevate our own standing as well. There's no reason to refuse.”

In other words, Father has seized a chance to raise Allerton’s value by becoming relatives with the House of Margrave Harvey.

Which means the reason he called me here is—

“...The one to marry into their family is me, isn't it.”

“Of course. Why would I send away our precious heir? You, the useless one, are perfect.”

Useless. That’s how Father sees me—a parasite who only helps Brother with paperwork.

As Vice-Captain of the Royal Capital Guardian Knights, Father is rarely at home. I doubt he’s ever seen Brother’s work around the house.

But either way, the matter of succession is settled. Brother is the heir and already has a fiancée—Lady Belbetta of the House of Marquis Gerling.

So as the second son, it's only natural I be sent off for the good of the house.

Now then, what am I supposed to do?

“Understood. So, what are the instructions?”

“I'll give you three days. Pack your things immediately.”

“Huh?”

Three days. Pack my belongings.

That's so sudden... In other words, I have to leave this house in three days and marry into the Margrave's family.

Even if Father’s fine with that has the Harvey side agreed to such sudden timing?

That question was answered quickly.

“We proposed it, and the Harveys agreed. It wouldn’t do for the soon-to-be head of the family to have a useless younger brother hanging around.”

Hah. I see how it is.

So I’m not even allowed to attend my own brother’s wedding, am I, Father?

“...I... under... stand.”

I get it. If that's the case, I'll pack my things right away.

I don’t know how they’ll treat me at the House of Margrave Harvey, but... it can’t be worse than here.

Ah... but in the end, I won’t get to see Vee again. Well, of course not what we had was just a childhood promise, after all.

Still, I made it to eighteen, and now I’m finally leaving House Allerton. Vee.

Well then.

“Preparing for marriage,” but I didn’t have much to pack anyway.

“Since I’m technically going as a son-in-law, they should provide the essentials. So…”

If I bring a decent set of clothes and undergarments, I can probably get more there.

I’ll take my favorite stationery my pen, ink, and a notepad made of scrap paper. I can’t afford to waste nice paper over there. I’ll need ink for writing documents, though I can probably request that if needed.

Also, books. Textbooks for learning the languages of the neighboring countries, and the picture books I used to read as a child. They’re precious to me, but if I leave them here, they’ll probably be thrown out.

“...I guess this is it.”

If I were a woman, I’d probably bring jewelry gifted by my mother or fiancé. But I’m a man and the good-for-nothing second son, always in my brother’s shadow.

When my brother joined the knights, Father gave him a sword, which he displays in his room. I never got anything like that.

I was supposedly given a protective dagger when I was born, but it’s nowhere to be found in my room. Brother once came in and took a bunch of things, saying they were wasted on me so it was probably among those.

“Well, whatever.”

I’m no longer a member of House Allerton. I don’t need its dagger.

…As long as I can live decently in House Harvey, that’ll be enough. Yeah.

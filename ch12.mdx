After that, Demian smoothed things over by saying, “First, everyone, please have a chat over some tea,” so we all trooped together into the reception room.  

Ah… yeah, I had kind of frozen up, so I was grateful for that.

I didn’t say this out loud, but it was a little funny how His Lordship the Margrave muttered, “Don’t glare like that, Demian…” looking slightly deflated.  

I guess that makes sense— Demian was his martial arts instructor, after all. Even now, there must be times when His Lordship can’t quite stand up to him.

“Well then, once again Theodore, thank you for coming to our House Harvey.”

And so, in the reception room, with tea and sweets prepared, I sat across the table from the Margrave and his lady.  

Naturally, Vee took a seat right next to me. Well… that’s fine, I guess.

“I am Cland Harvey, Violet’s father. I hold the rank of Margrave, protector of the frontier.”

His expression had switched from doting to sharply dignified—quite befitting of His Lordship.  
…If this had been my first impression of him, he might have been pretty intimidating.

“I am Majesta, Cland’s wife and Violet’s mother. Welcome, Theodore.”

The Margravine sitting beside him smiled radiantly. Her narrowed eyes held a strong presence, and I found myself sitting up straighter.

Vee had told me that her real name was Violet, and that her family called her “Vee.”  

But earlier, I heard His Lordship call the Margravine “Maj,” so she must have her own affectionate nickname. I kind of envy that.

“I am Theodore Allerton. I’m very grateful to have received such a good proposal.”

I didn’t know the proper formal greeting for this sort of situation, so I decided to be honest. Well, because for me leaving my Allerton home and entering House Harvey as Vee’s husband really _is_ a very good thing.

“Ever since Lady Violet’s words to me nine years ago, I’ve done my best, even if it’s nothing impressive.”

“I see.”

“I truly thank you for accepting her words, and for coming to fetch me.”

I bowed deeply, even though we were seated. I wouldn’t bow like that to Sir Demian or the servants, but this was the head and lady of House Harvey. They listened to Vee, and made her verbal promise into reality.

“Raise your head. It is we who should be thanking you.”

“…Yes.”

At His Lordship’s calm voice, I straightened my posture.  

Everyone’s eyes including Vee’s were on me.

Well, I suppose the Margrave has reason to thank me. It’s a benefit to House Harvey that the next heir, Vee, will have a spouse.

“Of course, we have our own reasons as well. I might as well be clear about them.”

So, there’s more to it than just Vee’s words. He’s about to tell me exactly why they accepted me as her husband. I should listen carefully.

“Certainly, my adorable Vee’s words played a part. And from our standpoint, it’s better for the family to bring in a son-in-law than to marry her out. But the fact that you are an Allerton is also one of the reasons.”

“Yes.”

So my being born into House Allerton was another reason I was accepted. I can understand that.

“I’ve heard that those of Allerton blood possess strong bodies. I’m not sure about the current head, but as for the previous Count, my father once sparred with him during military training. Demian, you were present as well, weren’t you?”

“Yes. The late Count Allerton possessed great physical strength, muscle, and martial skill— he fought the late Lord Harvey to a draw. His retainer, Barlot, was not quite at that level, however.”

…Wow. So my grandfather could fight the late Margrave to a standstill? That’s incredible.  

And… wait, is Demian stronger than Barlot?

I didn’t meet my grandfather often maybe a few times before or after that party he attended.  
When he stayed at the house, he was treated with a certain respect, but that was long ago.  
And in those days, my strongest memory was of Vee, so I don’t remember much else.

“To stand beside Vee meaning to one day lead House Harvey it is most reassuring if you have that strong body. And I hear you also handled all of your elder brother’s paperwork at House Allerton?”

“Yes huh?”

I answered automatically, then realized what I’d said.  

Only my brother, his close aides, and perhaps a few attendants should know that I managed all his paperwork. Father and Mother hardly ever paid me attention, so they wouldn’t know.

“You see, I have quite a few acquaintances in the Royal Capital Guardian Knights. One of your brother’s subordinates is a relative of mine.”

"You may not have met him, Theodore," the Marchioness added. "But it seems he's made to do things like gather materials, and your story came up in that context."

“…Ah. Well, I did compile and finalize all the materials they collected… I wonder if my brother’s managing now.”

The Margrave and Margravine’s words surprised me a little.  It’s not strange at all for someone connected to House Harvey to be in the Royal Capital Guardian Knights just as Allerton is, Harvey is a martial family.

But really… is my brother okay? Who’s handling all the document sorting and clean copies now?

“If Lord Theodore came here with Allerton’s approval, your brother surely has considered such matters. He’ll be fine.”

“That’s right. I can’t imagine he hasn’t thought about it.”

“Well, even if the clerical work suffers, it’s hardly our concern.”

The entire Harvey family laughed off my worry. Right whether my brother struggles is none of my business. Father and Mother probably think my absence won’t matter anyway. If my brother has a hard time, that’s his own fault.

“Now, Theodore, before your tea gets cold—please, go ahead. I chose something popular in the capital, but if you have a preference, do tell me.”

The Margravine spoke cheerfully, so I took a sip. I’m fine with most teas anyway… In my own home, no one ever bothered about what I liked.

The Allerton County is located about a day's carriage ride from the royal capital of the Komulas Kingdom. 

This seems to be influenced by the fact that the successive heads of the family have belonged to the Royal Capital Guardian Knights, serving as its senior officers. ...Or rather, it appears an ancestor who made a name for himself in the knights was granted the title and territory.

The current head of the house, my father, Count Jonas Allerton, serves as the vice-captain of the knights and the commander of the First Division. My older brother, Rodrick, the eldest son, serves under our father and is said to be currently in charge of a single unit.

"...Good grief."

Father currently entrusts a portion of his duties as lord to his successor, my brother Rodrick. And as for me, the second son, Theodore, I assist my brother, mainly by handling his paperwork... or so Father seems to think. 

At the very least, he believes it's only natural for me to help my older brother. That since my brother will inherit this house and succeed our father, I should assist him until I either marry into another family or become independent.

_But still..._ I think to myself as I knock on the door. It opens shortly after, and my brother's attendant welcomes me with a nod, gesturing for me to enter. Not that I have an attendant of my own.

"Excuse me, Brother."

I wheel the wagon stacked with documents into my brother Rodrick's room. I move it right next to his work desk and lock the wheels. 

Behind the imposing new desk, which is much grander than the one I use in my own room, my brother remains seated in an equally high-quality chair. The look he gives me is one of extreme boredom.

"I've brought today's documents."

"You're late."

"My apologies."

At my brother's displeased remark, I almost reflexively uttered an apology and bowed my head. If I didn't, the next moment I would be slammed against the wall by my brother's fist.

"Well, fine. I'm glad you're at least somewhat useful as my aide."

"Thank you."

After giving the documents on the desk a glance, my brother’s mood seems to improve. I bow again, this time in thanks.

…But the truth is, these documents should have been completed by my brother himself. When they’re submitted, they bear his signature as the responsible party. In other words, the higher-ups believe the contents were processed and compiled by him.

In reality, I wrote them. All of them. Is this really what an “assistant” is supposed to do?

"You've organized them properly, haven't you?"

"Yes."

There is much work to do, both as a Guardian Knight and as an assistant to the lord. Of course, in either position, one has subordinates, and it would be natural to use them skillfully to get the work done. 

However, my brother leaves all the document processing to me. It's a problem that goes beyond him simply saying it's natural because I'm his aide... to be precise, he dumps nearly everything on me. 

My job consists of processing the materials compiled by our father's and brother's subordinates, writing out clean copies, and bringing them to my brother's room. The attendant who opened the door his job is to bring those materials to me. At least, that's how it seems from my perspective.

"Alright. Then, here's the next batch."

It would be one thing if he at least reviewed the contents... but once, a document was sent back because of a small mistake, and my brother placed all the blame on me. Yes, it was certainly my mistake, but if my brother had checked it, he should have noticed. 

Even now, without even checking the documents, my brother brings out the next pile. From a quick glance, it appears to be the report on the recent monster subjugation.

"From noon, I have a tea party with Belbetta. I'll be back for dinner, but you can have this done by tomorrow evening."

"Understood."

My brother is dumping even the task of writing the report on me, while he himself goes to have tea with his fiancée, Lady Belbetta Gerling. He says I have until tomorrow evening, but if I take him at his word, I'll just end up being kicked and called a slacker. 

Lady Belbetta's family, the House of Marquis Gerling, is related to our mother's family, the House of Count Grassa. Apparently, because of that, their engagement was finalized after they met at a party nine years ago. Not that I would know I was completely left out of the loop.

"We're done here. Get out now, you're an eyesore."

"Yes, excuse me."

I bow deeply to my huffing brother and leave the room, pushing the wagon with the new documents. As the attendant closed the door, for a final moment, he scoffed at me. I believe he's the third son of a Viscount. I wonder if he's capable of doing his job without being rude.

"I can't help but think he could at least write the monster subjugation reports himself."

I mutter under my breath as I head back to my room. I glance at the pile on the wagon... no, the scribbled notes, and conclude that would be impossible. The truth is, my brother's handwriting is atrocious. Apparently, that attendant used to serve as his scribe, but now that role is mine. Still, a fiancée, huh. 

If I recall correctly, in four months, Lady Belbetta is set to become my sister-in-law. My brother, under the pretext of being busy with work, will probably dump all the wedding preparations on our parents. That tea party this afternoon was surely arranged entirely by our mother as well. 

Furthermore, the documents requiring my brother's own signature for the marriage and other related matters are in the pile I just brought him. There's no marriage certificate, of course, but there are various other things, like the future division of assets. Be that as it may.

"I wonder, have monsters been increasing lately?"

In the pile from before, there was also a monster subjugation report. And the documents I'm carrying now are more of the same. It's true that one of the important missions of the Royal Capital Guardian Knights is the subjugation of monsters near the capital. 

The Komulas Kingdom has an army and knight orders, but there are almost no wars with neighboring countries right now. While some countries occasionally cause trouble, they are supposed to be driven back by the nobles who hold territory on the border. 

Therefore, the work of my father and brother primarily consists of training their subordinates and subjugating monsters. If it were a place far from the royal capital, it would be a mission for the army of the local noble lord.

"...Oh, well. It has nothing to do with me."

I've never been allowed to spar with Father, but I've been thoroughly beaten by my brother time and time again. The moment I was being crushed by a brother only a year older, my path to joining the knights was sealed. 

Even if I submitted an application, Father or my brother would probably just tear it up, and that would be the end of it. Unable to match him in strength, I'm forced to handle almost all of the paperwork that my brother should be doing. If I refuse, I'm beaten to within an inch of my life, and our parents are simply told that I'm "resting due to poor health." 

I'm speaking from experience, by the way. Those parents... especially my mother, are completely unaware that I'm the one finishing almost all the documents my brother is supposed to handle. I know this because I've seen her praise my brother for his "beautiful handwriting." 

Her perception is likely that, at most, I am just helping my brother out a little bit. And that, since my esteemed brother is so busy, it's only natural for his useless younger brother to help.

"...Vee."

I wonder if you're doing well.

I'm doing my best.
